# Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
# Standard glob patterns work: Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. An aster- isk (*) matches zero or more characters; [abc] matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark (?) matches a single char- acter; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen ([0-9]) match- es any character between them (in this case 0 through 9). You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories; a/**/z would match a/z, a/b/z, a/b/c/z, and so on.
# You can start patterns with a forward slash (/) to avoid recursivity.
# You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.
# You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).
